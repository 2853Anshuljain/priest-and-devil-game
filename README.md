# Priests and Devils River Crossing Puzzle (Python with Tkinter)

This is a **Python** implementation of the classic **Priests and Devils** (also known as **Missionaries and Cannibals**) river crossing puzzle with an interactive **Tkinter-based GUI**.

## üéÆ Gameplay Rules

* You start with **3 Priests** and **3 Devils** on the left side of the river.
* A boat can carry **at most 2 people** at a time.
* At no point on either riverbank can the number of devils exceed the number of priests (if any priests are present), or the priests will be eaten!
* Safely move all characters to the right side.

## üõ† Features

* üö§ Smooth **animated boat and character movement**.
* ‚è± **Step counter** and **timer**.
* ‚Ü©Ô∏è **Undo** last move functionality.
* ü§ñ **BFS Solver** for hint or auto-solve.
* üîä Sound effects:

  * Boat rowing
  * Win sound when puzzle is solved
  * Lose sound if priests are eaten
* üìú Move history tracker

## üß† DSA Concepts Used

* `stack` ‚Äî Undo functionality
* `queue` ‚Äî BFS Solver (shortest path to win)
* `State` class ‚Äî Encapsulation of each game state
* State transition graph modeling

## üîß Installation

* Python 3.8+
* Tkinter (comes with standard Python)
* Pygame (for sound effects)
